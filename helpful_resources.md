This is a curated list of resources I've found or wanted to bookmark whilst working on learning React Native.

## Libraries/Tools

- [Core docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/more-resources.html)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) : library for building on, amongst other things, React Native and handling state.
- [Awesome React Native](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/) : Collation of React Native links and libraries. Like this but awesome-er?
- [React-Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) : Is this like the bootstrap of the React Native world? [Home Site](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [native-navigation](https://github.com/airbnb/native-navigation) : Seems to be the biggest competitor to the above. From Airbnb.
- [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) : This is the ide that the ReactNative creators build on. They seem to like it a lot.
- [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) : Toolkit with a CLI?
- [Code Push](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) : I reckon this helps you avoid going to the app store process for every char change.
